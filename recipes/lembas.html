    <h2>What is Lembas?</h2>
    <p>Lembas, also known as <strong>Elven Bread</strong> is a tipical travel-food made by Elves, in Lord of The Rings. In Tolkien's work, the bread is described as a food suitable for long journeys, which remains fresh and nutritious for many days, retaining its sweetness.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Turn the oven to medium heat so that it is heated when it is time to bake the lembas</li>
    <li>Blend the almonds in the blender</li>
    <li>In a cup or small bowl, place the eggs and mix with a fork until smooth</li>
    <li>Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and stir until combined</li>
    <li>Make a hole in the middle and add the eggs, honey and butter</li>
    <li>Mix everything until you have a dough that resembles bread dough (it has to keep coming away from the container although it is still a little sticky)</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface</li>
    <li>Knead the dough with a rolling pin or with your hands until it is a finger thick</li>
    <li>With a large, sharp knife, cut into 4 x 4 finger squares</li>
    <li>Make an "X" pressure with the knife from one end of the square to the other</li>
    <li>Place on a tray lined with parchment paper or greased, with 2 fingers apart</li>
    <li>Take it to the oven for 20 minutes and do the toothpick test (insert the toothpick in one of the lembas; if it comes out clean it's good)</li>
    <li>Wrap the lembas in cabbage leaves or napkins and tie with string like a small package</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have your elven bread!</p>
